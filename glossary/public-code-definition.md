# Public Code

Public code is both civic code (like policy or regulation) and computer source code (such as software and algorithms) executed in a public context, by humans or machines.

Because public code serves the public interest, it should be open, legible, accountable, accessible and sustainable.

Public code can be building blocks for others to re-use and re-implement in their local context, creating their public code. It can serve as a starting point to continue development or as a basis for learning. To enable that, the development of public code needs to be independent from, but implementable in, those contexts. The development process must also be openly documented.

To facilitate re-use, public code should be either released into the public domain or licenced with an open licence that permits others to view and reuse the work freely and to produce derivative works.
