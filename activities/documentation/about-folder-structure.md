# Folder structure of about.publiccode.net

About has a folder structure that serves as a basic skeleton for our information.

As any organization is formed by the information structure it is up to all of us to make sure we make the documentation we write for one specific use case easy to incorporate in other cases.

In order to prevent silos we don't split our activities with the roles that most commonly do them or where the responsibility lies.
This helps us share more activities, create communities of practice and remove duplication wherever possible.

Folders:

* `activities`: All of our activities and processes. These are interlinked and are often built on each other.
  * Inside of activities there is one folder per activity with its own index, resources and guides. These serve as the documentation shared by that community of practice.
* `contributor-guides`: Explains how each user type can contribute. For example designers, developers or policy people.
* `glossary`: The controlled terms we have a shared definition for.
* `organization`: Core information on the organization such as the mission, statues and business information.
* `roles`: We no longer use this. This used to house the roles we have in the organization, also known as job descriptions.

When nesting becomes deep, consider breaking content up and using links to create connections.
