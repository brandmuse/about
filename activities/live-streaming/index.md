# Live streamed podcast

We use live streams as a tool to communicate. The format we have chosen is a podcast style live stream and we call the show **Let's talk about Public Code**.

## Goals

- **Become discoverable:** Create another way for people we would like to know who don't know that we exist or what we do *to discover us*.
- **Grow** our codebase's **community**.
- Get in **touch directly with key figures** of top projects. Possible way in to steward or make them members of the Foundation for Public Code.
- Get **more** Social Media **followers** since we are going to use those networks for this project.

## Formats, length and schedule

1. **Frequency**: Ambition to make it at least monthly.
2. Two different **formats**: one for codebases, one for the Foundation.
3. For the codebases, the format is an interview by two codebase stewards with someone from a codebase.
4. For the Foundation, the format is a conversation between two persons from the foundation. This can be theoretical, about ideas and principles or about news.
5. Language: English.
6. Have one or a few recurrent questions we ask every guest. That builds familiarity of the show and can also reveal aspects / differences between codebases.
7. Timing: minimum 20 minute livestream during business hours - start 2pm UTC. Promise that the podcast will be live by close of business the next day. Aim to hold this on Tuesdays.

### Guest selection criteria

Guests have an interesting perspective to contribute to the development of public codebase stewardship based on their own experience. They can come from anywhere (including non-public open source projects).
The overlap between the guest's experience and our interests should be clear in the invitation, the question guide and our communications for the podcast.

## Target audience

Codebase level:

- Civil servants working on public code codebases (ie. potential stewardship material) and project managers.
- Civic tech people working on codebases in use by public organizations.
- People interested in free and open source software in general.
- People interested by specific types of software.
- Media following up on a particular codebase or use case.
- The codebase being interviewed and its followers.
- Politicians interested in a specific project/city.
- Vendors/tenders.
- Other people involved in the codebase: designers, user experience, communication, competitors, etc.

## Distribution

We use [Streamyard](../tool-management/streamyard.md) as a tool for the live stream, it can stream to several platforms. For the podcast, we use [Podbean](../tool-management/podbean.md).

## Guides

We have three guides that will help us doing the live stream in an easily repeated way:

- [Prepare the live stream](prepare-live-stream.md)
- [Manage the live stream](manage-live-stream.md)
- [Post-production](post-production.md)
