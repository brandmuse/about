# Managing a live stream

When running a [live stream](index.md) of 'Let's talk about  public code' there are some steps to remember:

- Test everything before going live.
- Prepare tabs with easy access to moderation tools of the different platforms to be able to intervene in case of offensive commenting. Preferably, this is done by a staff member not in the actual interview.
- Meet with the guest in [StreamYard](../tool-management/streamyard.md) 30 minutes before going live.
- Keep an eye on attendees' questions and behavior: when are they connecting, which is the most successful platform and why, best timing, etc.
- When it's time to start the stream, press Go live and quickly start the intro video.
- Start by only having the interviewers on screen.
- Remind the audience what the Foundation for Public Code does and how to contact us in an easy way.
- Present the guest and bring them on screen.
- Run the interview.
- Bring up interesting questions from the audience on the screen and read them out loud to the interviewee.
- Remember that there will be a podcast version afterwards, so make sure to explain things so that someone only listening to the show will understand (in case of shared screens or funny things happening on camera).
- The last question we always ask our guest is "Please name someone you think we should interview in our upcoming episodes, and explain why?"
- Remind the audience at the end of ways of keeping in touch with us.
- When the show is over start the outro video and quickly press Stop recording.
