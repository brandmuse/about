# Preparing a live stream

When setting up a new [live stream](index.md) for 'Let's talk about public code' there are some steps to remember.

## Who, when and what

- Decide who will be the next guest
- Decide the date and time of the stream
- Prepare questions for the interview in a HackMD shared with all interviewers
- Share the questions with the guest so no delays happen and they can run it with their communications department if needed
- An ace up your sleeve: backup name in case the current guest can't make it. Ideally, that person would be the next guest
- Update the running script intro and rounding off sections

## Platform preparations

- Make a new intro video with the [BumperScripter](https://github.com/publiccodenet/bumperscripter), adding the guest and organization
- Create a new preview image adding the guest and organisation with the help of this [template](preview-image.svg)
- In the week before the stream, create a new broadcast in [StreamYard](../tool-management/streamyard.md)
- Upload the new intro video in Streamyard, remove the old one to avoid confusion during the stream
- Update banners with links related to the upcoming show

## Communication

Ready **three weeks** (at least) in advance:

- Copies
- Images
- Graphs
- Social media campaign: short video with the guest if possible
- Shared strategy with the stakeholders involved for every interview
