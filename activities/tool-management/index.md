# Tool management and guidance

The Foundation for Public Code needs tools to accomplish its mission. This is how we manage our tools:

* [Tool and email naming conventions](tool-and-email-naming-conventions.md)
* [How to test a tool](tool-testing.md)

# Tool overview

* [Jitsi Meet is our videoconfering tool.](jitsi-meet.md)
