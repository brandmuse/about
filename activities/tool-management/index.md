# Tool management and guidance

The Foundation for Public Code needs tools to accomplish its mission. This is how we manage our tools:

* [Tool and email naming conventions](tool-and-email-naming-conventions.md)
* [How to test a tool](tool-testing.md)
* [Using chat.publiccode.net](using-chat.md)
* [Streaming with Streamyard](streamyard.md)
* [Podcasts with Podbean](podbean.md)
