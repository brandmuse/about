# Odoo Community

Odoo is a suite of open source business apps. We use Odoo for:

* customer relationship management (CRM)
* project management of our codebase and membership pipelines
* emailing our newsletter and announcements to people who have [signed up for our mailing lists](https://forms.gle/gn7wR2Eaxbv5g1BF9)

## Using Odoo

We offer training to new staff.

## Odoo management

Our service provider is OpenWorx.

The Operations coordinator takes care of user administration, reports bugs and is the contact person for the service provider.

### Odoo aliases

The aliases are necessary to send external emails directly to the right pipeline. The aliases are managed via the Google Workspace group admin panel and the backend of Odoo in developer mode with assets. The Operations Coordinator has [documented how aliases work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KYmWUHCS-bA5Bqi2wQzl11D1QIxbtwr-Qtl2PEwKDw8/edit) and are set up. There is also an [overview of aliases currently in use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jkyAFQuwspuLyJNc0zi_9Lw_xbHS4qcIavfAWMWTSIE/edit#gid=0).
