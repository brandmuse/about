# Odoo Community

Odoo is a suite of open source business apps that cover all your company needs: CRM, eCommerce, accounting, inventory, point of sale, and project management.

## Guidance on using Odoo

We use Odoo's CRM and project management capabilities for managing our Codebases and Membership pipelines.

## Odoo Management

Odoo Community is currently hosted and maintained by a service provider in the UK. We are migrating our instance to a Dutch provider late November 2020.

## Odoo Privacy Policy

> Our future service provider has published their 'verwerkersovereenkomst' [on their website](https://www.openworx.nl/verwerkersovereenkomst). 
Their [privacy policy](https://www.openworx.nl/privacy-statement) (also in Dutch) is available as well.
