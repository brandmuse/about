# Plausible Analytics

Plausible Analytics is a simple, lightweight (< 1 KB), open source and privacy-friendly analytics tool. It doesn’t use cookies.

We're currently trialling Plausible (see [issue 64](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme/issues/64).)

## Using Plausible Analytics

Plausible Analytics is integrated into our [Jekyll-theme](https://github.com/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme), which is used by all our websites (since all are built with Github Pages). It gives us a simple open source analytics dashboard, including website metrics such as the number of unique visitors, the number of page views on individual pages and the referral sources that have sent traffic to our site. 

We will use this data to assess the performance of our site and to figure out what we can do to improve our future efforts.

## Plausible management

Plausible Analytics works by loading a Javascript script on the top navigation of our websites. The dashboard can be accessed by the Codebase Stewards and Communication Coordinator.

## Privacy and GDPR

Plausible doesn't collect or store any personal or identifiable information. Their data is hosted in Germany. Plausible is designed to be GDPR, CCPA and cookie law compliant. Read more in [Plausible's data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

> "We do not track people across their devices and across websites and apps that they visit. All the data is isolated to a single day, single website and single device only. There is no way to know whether the same person visits a site from more than one device or visits another website. When you use our service to measure your website stats, Plausible Analytics will collect information about your visitors. You entrust us with your site data and we take that trust to heart. The privacy of your site data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. By using Plausible, you keep 100% ownership of your website data. Although when using our hosted service, your site analytics are stored on our server in the cloud, you remain completely in control of your site data and you fully own all of your data too. You own all right, title, and interest to your website data. We obtain no rights from you to your website data. We will never sell or share your site data to any third-parties."
