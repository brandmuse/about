# Jitsi Meet

Jitsi Meet is our videocall and conference tool. Jitsi an open-source projects that allows us to deploy secure video conferencing solutions. 
At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which lets us have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the 
community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.

## Guidance on using Jitsi Meet

All our team members can create rooms. The link to the room can be shared publicly or secretly, depending on the purpose of the meeting.
The first person to create or enter an existing room is the host, and is required to authenticate by entering their log-in credentials.
Guest can join the meeting when the have the link. As an extra security measure a password can be added to the room, so guest 
also need the password next to the meeting link.

### Jitsi Administration

Jitsi is running on a VPS with 8 GB of RAM and is maintained and upgraded by the operations coordinator.
