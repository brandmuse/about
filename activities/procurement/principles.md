# Procurement principles

To fulfill our mission, we need to be able to be open, reliable, trustworthy, helpful and sustainable.

This means the services and products we use need to be:

* professional
* reliable
* replaceable
* sustainable for the organization as well as society and the planet

As [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) states, "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

The principles of our procurement build on and extend our [cultural values](../../organization/cultural-values.md) and [communication principles](../communication/communication-principles.md).
