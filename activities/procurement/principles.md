# Procurement principles

To fulfill our mission, we need to be able to be open, reliable, trustworthy, helpful and sustainable.

This means the services and products we use need to be:

* professional
* reliable
* replaceable
* sustainable for the organization as well as society and the planet

The principles of our procurement build on and extend our [cultural values](../../organization/cultural-values.md) and [communication principles](../communication/communication-principles.md).

## Procurement process

To make sure the procurement process is fair, we adhere to the following requirements:

* we request 3 - 4 quotes from different providers
* check if prices are competitive and in line with the market
* if products are sustainable and / or local
* final decision taken with operations team
