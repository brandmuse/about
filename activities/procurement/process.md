# Procurement process

Our process for procurement of services, and in some cases goods, is as follows:

1. we request a proposal or quote
2. we check if price and value are market-conform
3. if products and services are in line with our [procurement principles](principles.md)
4. the order is placed by the operations team and signed off by the chief executive and board of directors, if needed
