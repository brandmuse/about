# How to gift in the Netherlands through ANBI

You may deduct a donation to an ANBI (general benefit charity) in your income tax return. The conditions are different for a periodic gift and an ordinairy gift.

## Your gift is a periodic gift if you meet these 3 conditions:

1. You give the same amount annually to the same institution or association. You may decide for yourself whether you pay your annual donation in one go or several times
2. You pay the amount 5 years in a row. Longer is also allowed.
3. You have determined when your annual donation stops. For example, after 5 years or when you die.

## Your gift is an ordinairy gift:

An ordinary gift is a gift you only make once. Or a gift that you do annually, but have not laid down in an agreement.
You may deduct your ordinary gift if you meet the following conditions:

1. Your donation will go to an ANBI (public utility charity). If the ANBI is really an ANBI, you can check with our program ANBI search.
2. Your donation is voluntary. You are not allowed to deduct a mandatory contribution to your church.
3. You get nothing in exchange for your donation. Buying a lottery ticket, for example, is not a gift, because in exchange you get the chance to win something.
4. You can prove that you have made the gift. This can be seen, for example, from the write-downs on your account.
