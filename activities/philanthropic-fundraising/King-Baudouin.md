# How to donate through the King Baudouin Foundation

The Foundation for Public Code has set up a so called "Advised Gift Fund" at the King Baudoin Foundation in the U.S. 
Through the Online Giving Center you can make secure, tax deductible (credit card) donations to us. 

You can find our fund information page in the King Baudoin [Online Giving Center.](https://kbfus.networkforgood.com/projects/52915-p-kbfus-funds-foundation-for-public-code-nl)

Alternative ways to give:

For gifts by check: Write your check to KBFUS, write "Foundation for Public Code US Fund" in the memo section of the check, 
and send it to KBFUS, 10 Rockefeller Plaza, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10020.

Gifts by wire transfer or to contribute other types of property: E-mail KBFUS at: info@kbfus.org or phone +1 (212) 713 7660.

Because KBFUS is a public charity, within the meaning of Sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(1) of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code, donors may be eligible for a U.S. income tax deduction for their contribution to
the Advised Gift Fund, to the extent permitted by U.S. tax law.
