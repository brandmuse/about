# Communication principles

The Foundation For Public Code itself is open source.

Our communication principles are:

* open, unless
* invites contributions by all
* clearly explained
* hypertextual, web first
* interactive
* publishable

As [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) states, "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
