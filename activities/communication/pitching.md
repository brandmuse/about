# Pitching the Foundation for Public Code

Staff often find themselves needing to pitch the Foundation for Public Code to diverse audiences, which can be daunting if you've never done it before. We've collected pitches we already use so it's easier to practice.

## Audiences

These are the audiences we've spoken to about the Foundation for Public Code:

* managers at a public organization
* general policy experts or civil servants
* developers at a public organization
* digital or tech people who work for a public organization
* general developers and other digital or tech people
* open source enthusiasts
* 'open' enthusiasts
* vendors to government
* the general public
* politicians and politicians' assistants or special political advisors (SPADs)
* journalists
* activists
* philanthropists

## Opening lines

These are pitches we already use.

For developers, tech people and open source enthusiasts:

* "You know the Free Software Foundation Europe's (FSFE) [Public Money, Public Code] campaign? We're helping public organizations actually do it."

For people with government experience or interest:

* "We're helping public organizations that develop their own software to collaborate and share it with other public organizations so that the public doesn't need to duplicate the work."
* [Boris pitches]

For the general public, assuming no prior technology or government experience:

* "Today, municipalities and government agencies have small pieces of software to provide services, and every municipality has their own. But rather than contracting to consulting companies to build their version, municipalities could pool together and make an open source one. Then each municipality only has to customise it to what they need. We help them work together."
* "We help cities build and maintain public-purpose open source software together."

For cocktail party audiences, assuming no interest at all:

* "I work for an NGO that helps cities use open source software."
  
## Tips when starting a conversation

Always tailor your explanation to your interlocutor's interests and background knowledge. For example, "avoiding vendor-lockin" and "avoiding duplicating work" are actually the same argument - just aimed at different audiences.

### Metaphors

If you know someone has background with an organization, you can use it as a metaphor.
For example:

* "We're like [MediaWiki Stakeholders' Group](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki_Stakeholders%27_Group), but for open source software for public organizations."
* "We're like the [Apache Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), but for codebases that only make sense for government."

### 'Open source' is controversial

We have different perspectives on open source:

* Don't use 'open source' if you don't know your interlocutor knows about it - say 'collaborate and share'
* Deliberately use 'open source' to filter people based on their technological knowledge level
* 'Open source' really resonates with activists - open source is hands on democracy in action

### We're apolitical

Avoid: "we think or we believe" [open source is better]
Instead, describe what we do: "we help municipalities [share collaborative software].

### Contextual knowledge

Check whether your interlocutor knows about:

* policy
* open source
* civil servants (who aren't frontline service providers like trash collectors or politically elected, like mayors)
* public code

You'll probably need to explain these concepts first.

### Local norms 

What is the interlocutor's experience of government?

* do they trust their governments?
* what are their expectations of government efficiency and ethics?
* do they expect that vendors only get contracts through corruption?

When talking to someone who doesn't trust government officials' ethics or efficiency...**[what?]**

## Follow up questions

These are follow up questions we've received, and answers staff have given.

Are you a lobbying org? Are you the same as the FSFE?

* No, we work with the organizations that have already decided to use open source. There are already so many organizations that have already decided that "we don't waste our time trying to convince the others".

Where does your money come from?

* the runway was provided by a philanthropic grant, but long term the members of the association (which must be wholly publicly owned, like cities, provinces, states) pool the money in and decide which codebases we should be working on. Expect that long term this will remain a combination.
* we're member-funded, but how to get members for a new association is a chicken and egg problem, so we started wtih philanthropic grant
* member dues apy for our core activities; philanthropy allows us to develop new approaches, test assets/r&D/expansion before we apply these to core activities, which are effectively taxpayer funded

What donor influence - do you have a conflict of interest?

* No, only the public owned orgs can steer the organization (through votes in the general assembly)
* No, philanthropists can give money, and sit on an advisory committee, but only members (publicly owned organizations) can vote in the general assembly or appoint the board of directors
* No, we also don't do work for hire; you can't pay the Foudnation to do work

Is now the right time and place? What about incumbent vendors?

* we'll have to see, but the idea is that we'll work with the vendors to get them more work as more public organizations start using the same codebase

Why are you an association when you're called a Foundation?

* Foundations can be bought out and subverted by corporate interests, this form of association cannot be.
* The Foundation for Public Code is registered as an association because this structure was the best fit for our goals under Dutch law.

As a reminder, our goals are:

* to stay member owned in perpetuity (and the only wholly publicly owned organizations can be members)
* to make it hard for a corporate interest to dominate the Foundation for Public Code (so we can't 'sell out')

## Practice game

To get more comfortable with these different pitches, we propose a game.

1. Create a card for each pitch and audience type. 
2. Shuffle the decks.
3. Have someone draw a pitch and an audience.
4. Practice giving the pitch!
5. Optional: have other players give feedback or score the pitch.

A more advanced version could include:

* opening topics to segue from
* interloctor's country of origin
* interlocutor's private motivation (for example money, security, democracy, public relations, being collaborative, seeking partners, seeking sales or leads for their company)
