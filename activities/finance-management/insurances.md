# Insurances

We work with an insurance intermediary [Zicht Adviseurs](https://www.zichtadviseurs.nl/zakelijk) for all our insurances. Contract renewals and invoices are both sent by snail-mail or via email and saved in a physical folder in the desk cabinet underneath the Chief Executive desk.

We have the following insurances:

* Corporate Liability
* Board insurance
* Travel insurance for team
* Absenteeism insurance (sickness)
* Inventory insurance (office furniture) includes fire insurance

Detailed overview of insurances and terms can be found [on our Secret Drive.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xbO--Pjr5CFDKTbaFiMS8A_SpEAIS06A)
