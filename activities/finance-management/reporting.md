# Reporting

## Board meeting reports

A concise financial one-pager is produced by the Operations Coordinator for the bi-monthly board meeting. The one-pager gives an overview of:

* The current cash position
* Costs incurred
* Runway
* General information (depending on time of the year, e.g. updates on (new) funding sources, important budget changes and interim conclusion)

## Annual reporting

Annual reporting consists of the annual financial statement and an annual report. The latter is a powerful piece of communications that shows how we deliver on our mission, and celebrate our accomplishments.

## Financial annual statement

Our first financial year runs from 1 July 2019 - 31 December 2020. The Operations Coordinator is working closely with the bookkeeper to produce the statement. An ANBI has to publish the financial statement on our website. The financial statement may concern the following information:

* The balance sheet
* The profit and loss statement
* An additional explanation

The financial statement must be published on our website within 6 six months after the end of the financial year.
