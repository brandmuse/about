# Authorization

Two board members can approve payments above € 50.000. [See bylaws.](../../organization/articles-of-association.md)

Based on the bylaws, no natural person or legal entity can dispose of the assets of the Foundation for Public Code as if such assets were their own. The board of directors (bestuur) needs the approval of the general assembly for all expenses over € 500.000 (article 21.5a of the bylaws). The board of directors also needs the general assembly’s approval for loaning or borrowing over € 100.000 (article 21.5b of the bylaws).

Payments below € 5000 can be made directly by the Operations Coordinator.
