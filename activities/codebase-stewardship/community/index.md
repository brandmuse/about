# Community

Successful open source codebases build a diverse community of public organizations and vendors to implement and support the product. This includes multiple public organizations contracting new development work, and multiple developing parties adding code to the repository.

The Foundation for Public Code helps facilitate these interactions around the code - for example by setting up community calls and forums, answering questions for newcomers, and facilitating the governance and technical steering in a way that is open and inclusive to everyone working at the code level (including developers, implementers and open source enthusiasts). This helps avoid duplicate work, and ensures new actors beyond those already involved can join and participate easily.

Community stewardship includes:

* [supporting, consulting on and executing governance](/supporting-governance/index.md)
* supporting committees such as technical steering committees
* [organizing events](../../events/index.md)
* processing feedback and contributions
* organizing [community calls](/community-calls/index.md)
* organizing [workshops](../../workshops/index.md)
