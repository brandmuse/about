# Product marketing

Successful open source codebases involve a wide community to partake in the actions described above.

The Foundation for Public Code supports the marketing of codebases to reach public organizations and vendors beyond (the network of) the current community. This can include help with the codebaseâ€™s branding, storytelling and marketing assets. This helps make the codebase attractive internationally and to new vendors, and easier to scale in the local context.

Product marketing stewardship includes:

* codebase branding
* codebase storytelling, communications and public relations
* marketing
* developer advocacy
