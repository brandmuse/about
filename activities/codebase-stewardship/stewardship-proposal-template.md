# Codebase stewardship proposal template

This is a template document for codebase stewardship proposals. 

We can send this document to the principal maintainer of a codebase to help them get their organizations commitment to stewardship. It can also be sent to other community members. 

We can do this after one or several introductory meetings with the maintainers and other community members.
