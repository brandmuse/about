# Template for a simple governance file

The text below can be used as a template for creating a governance file in a repository for a codebase. For easiest copy-paste it is rendered with code style here.

[Codebase] governance

In all things, we strive to follow our principles.

The maintainers of [codebase] have two steering teams: a technical one and a product one.

This codebase is under stewardship with the [Foundation for Public Code](https://publiccode.net/), which supports [codebase]'s governance, the product and technical steering teams, and the broader [codebase] community.

## Principles

As a community we want make it easier for new users to become contributors and maintainers.

The [codebase] community adheres to the following principles:

* [codebase] is open source
* we are welcoming and respectful, as mentioned in our Code of Conduct [add link]
* we are transparent and accessible: changes to the [codebase] organization, [codebase] code repositories, and [codebase] related activities (like level or involvement) are done in public
* ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles

## Technical steering team

[codebase]'s technical steering team members are active contributors whose day-to-day activities include:

* merging pull requests
* handling code of conduct violations
* overseeing the resolution and disclosure of security issues

Together, technical steering team is responsible for:

* providing technical direction for the codebase
* maintaining a technical roadmap, an architecture and coding principles
* resolving issues in development or conflicts between contributors
* managing and planning releases
* controlling rights to [codebase] assets such as source repositories

Any active member of the community can request to become a technical steering team member by asking the technical steering team. Members are appointed by the current technical steering team members.

### Working process

The technical steering team meets regularly. Their agenda includes review of the technical roadmap and issues that are at an impasse. The intention of the agenda is not to review or approve all patches. This is mainly done through the process described in CONTRIBUTING.md [add link].

If more than one technical steering team member disagrees with a decision of the technical steering team they may appeal to the product steering team who will make the ultimate ruling.

Ideally, no one company or organization will employ a simple majority of the technical steering team.

## Product steering team

The product steering team is responsible for:

* maintaining the mission, vision, values, and scope of the project
* collecting planned features and presenting them in a unified view
* refining the governance as needed
* making codebase level decisions
* resolving escalated project decisions when the sub-team responsible is blocked
* managing the [codebase] brand
* licensing and intellectual property changes
* controlling access to [codebase] assets such as hosting and project calendars

Any active member of the community can request to become a product steering team member by asking the product steering team. Members are appointed by the current product steering team members.

Changes in codebase governance can only be made with a super majority of the product steering team.

## Decision-making process

The default decision-making process for both steering teams is lazy consensus. This means that any decision is considered supported by the team making it as long as no one objects. Silence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will.

When a consensus cannot be found a team member can call for a majority vote on a decision. Each team member has 1 vote.

Many of the day-to-day project maintenance tasks can be done by a lazy consensus model. But the following items must be called to vote:

* adding a team member (simple majority)
* removing a team member (super majority)
* adding, archiving, or removing sub-projects (simple majority)
* changing the governance rules (this document) (super majority of the product team)
* licensing and intellectual property changes (including new logos, wordmarks) (simple majority of the product team)

## Code of Conduct violations

[codebase]'s Code of Conduct is explained in CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md [add link].

We expect steering team members to follow our code of conduct like any other community member. If you have an issue with a steering team member, contact someone on the product steering team.

If a steering team member is involved in a possible code of conduct violation, that member will be recused from reviewing or voting on the issue.
