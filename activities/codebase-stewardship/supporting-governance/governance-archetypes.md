# Collection of governance archetypes

Governance models can take may forms but within all these there are some common traits for different properties. Together, they can be said to form an archetype.

## Properties

Common properties, or methods and processes in some cases, of governance are:

* organizational setup
* voting mechanisms
* membership

These properties will in one way or the other be reflected in one or several of the [common sections for a governance models](index.md).

### Organizational setup

How is the organizational setup of the governance of the codebase? From no organization at all, everyone just makes pull requests and reviews ad-hoc to very formal systems with meetings, layers of committees and working groups and roadmaps.

List of common groups:

* governance body
* technical steering group
* specific working groups or special interest groups
* user groups
* maintainers
* reviewers

<!-- All these could possibly have their own sub pages that explain them more in detail. -->

### Voting mechanisms

When voting is needed (if at all), how is it being done? Are votes distributed evenly or according to any model the community prefers?

### Membership

How do one become a "member" of a certain group or committee? Is it just being handed out on a trust based level or does one need to prove affiliations in some way or does some even need membership fees of sorts to be paid?

## Examples

### A

The governance is mainly handled through a governance body. Any public body that wants to join the governance body must pay a membership fee to become a member of it. All members have one vote each. The governance body can delegate tasks to sub committees. The governance body's main function is to gather twice a year to update a feature roadmap.

### B

The governance is mainly handled through a governance body. The body has three seats, one for the original maintainer, one for public bodies that are using the codebase and one for an association of individuals. To become a member in the association of individuals you pay a membership fee. There is a technical steering group that give advice to the governance body and that makes a technical roadmap informed by the feature roadmap from the governance body.
