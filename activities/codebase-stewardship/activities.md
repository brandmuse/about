# Activities performed in codebase stewardship

We provide codebase stewardship at the codebase level. Stewardship activities take place in 4 domains:

* [community](community/index.md)
* [product marketing](product-marketing/index.md)
* [quality](quality/index.md)
* [support](support//index.md)

## Stewardship at the codebase level

The [goals of codebase stewardship](goals.md) are to maximize the reuse of the [codebase](../../glossary/codebase-definition.md) and promote the long term sustainability of the community around the codebase.

As such, all our activities are explicitly targeted at the codebase level. We do not perform them at the level of, or for the benefit of, individual community members, local geographical contexts or specific legal contexts.
