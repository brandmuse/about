# Quality

Successful open source codebases leverage economies of scale in a decentralized manner - various developers add features and fix bugs, while various implementers support public organizations in their implementations.

The Foundation for Public Code helps guarantee that all the code and corresponding documentation is ready for reuse. This includes a quality check on all new code added to the repository, and making sure everything is properly explained so other people can use it in their work. This helps all parties involved trust each otherâ€™s code and work - allowing them to build on each other.

Quality stewardship includes:

* [codebase auditing](../../codebase-auditing/index.md): code, policy and documentation quality assurance
* packaging and distributing official versions
* security and compatibility monitoring
* monitoring codebase compliance towards any future versions of the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/)
