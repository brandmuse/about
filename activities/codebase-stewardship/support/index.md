# Support

Successful open source codebases build a diverse vendor network for development, maintenance, implementation and hosting.

The Foundation for Public Code explicitly looks at the code and documentation from a vendor perspective, to help make sure it is commercially viable for them to work with the codebase. This can include hosting introductory open days to the codebase, giving training to new vendors, helping to resolve questions and doubts, and facilitating communication with their client public organizations.

Support stewardship includes:

* user support
* [trainings](../../trainings/index.md)
* project infrastructure and process management
* intellectual property management and trademark protection
* support with vendor relations, including maintenance, implementation and integration partners as well as hosting providers
