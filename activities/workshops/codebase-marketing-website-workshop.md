# Product marketing workshop: build an MVP marketing site

This is a session on making a codebase easy to find and reuse. It requires a small group to all work on the same codebase, though they can have different information about it.

It's easier to run this workshop for people who work on the same codebase or come from the same organization.

If you're running it for people who don't share a codebase, give them this scenario:

Your city has software to manage a citywide festival.

This session requires large pieces of paper (at least 3 per group) and colored markers. Some groups also like having post-its.

This session does not require laptops.

This session lasts 2 hours with no breaks. If you have more time, consider giving more time for discussion in section 1.

## Intro (5 minutes)

Script:

```Thanks for coming. In groups with your colleagues, we're going to build a mock up of a marketing site for your codebase.
We're going to work in small groups - always don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions.
```

To manage expectations, give an overview of numbered sections and timing (or have this up on a wall to point to.)

## 1. Imagine a world of possible reusers of your codebase (14 minutes)

Give people a new question plus the time every 2 minutes - warn them this will be happening.
Writing each question on a separate piece of flipboard paper maintains the momentum and ensures more consistent results. But participants find it more comfortable if they can see all questions at once and choose where to linger or speed up.

### Abstract questions about codebase branding (12 minutes)

Discuss these questions in small groups. The goal is to get the group thinking about something they're very familiar with from the perspective of someone who's never encountered it before.


1. What does it do now?
    * what will it do in the future? (6-18 months)
    * What are your aspirations for it?
5. What is the smallest number of words you can communicate the function of the codebase with?
2. Who are the people for whom this codebase matters?
3. List 5 adjectives to describe this codebase
4. If this codebase were an animal, what would it be?
6. What is the best advertising merchandise for this codebase? (for example, is this a paperweight or a goofy hat or pool float?)

### How do you like being marketed to? (10 minutes)

Answer these questions in your groups based on your personal experience - you've all been consumers of software, whatever your professional role.

1. Going quickly, list all the elements that you find persuasive in marketing for software.

2. Now make a 2nd list. If you were trying to persuade someone in your work to buy software, would you need anything that's not on the first list to persuade them?

#### OPTIONAL speedy laptop exercise: look up these codebases. What information can you get? Would you reuse them?

**10 min**
## 2. Identify common elements in other codebase marketing sites (10 minutes)

Put up print outs of other glossy marketing sites on A2.

Models:
* [Open ePlatform](http://www.oeplatform.org/) (Sweden)
* [IO](https://io.italia.it/) (Italy)
* [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) (UK)
* [OS2 MO](https://os2.eu/node/4865/wiki) has every tab complete
    * vs [OS2 Loop](https://os2.eu/produkt/os2loop) which only has a landing page (but still has a video!)


At the wall, circle common elements on the A2:
- Get highlighters in 6(?) colors
- Make a key as you go of common elements that appear on each of the marketing sites (eg: links to developer docs, links to vendors, callout for press and media, benefits for citizens, benefits for other public orgs, links to other documetnation?)

#### Common elements


Notify:





Talk about it:
- prioritisation - dot voting for what's most important (MVP marketing page)

**15:47-16:00**
## 3. Group exercise: make a marketing site for your own codebase (15 minutes)

OPTIONAL: SHOW OFF OUR TEMPLATE, ASK THEM TO FOCUS ON THE CONTENT


Now, based on:
- what you know your codebase does
- your aspirations for your codebase
- your feelings about it
AND
- what you find persuasive
- what your colleagues would find persuasive
- the models of other public code websites

Design a marketing site for your codebase
Use the big piece of paper on your tables.
There's also art supplies.

I'll leave the printouts of the other sites up on the wall in case you want to refer to them.

**8 min**

### 4. Show and tell to the room

**2 min**
### 5. Is there anything you've seen on another site that was inspirational? Is there anything that you'd like to borrow?
