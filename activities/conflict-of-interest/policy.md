# Conflict of Interest policy

Interested parties must identify, avoid and disclose an actual or perceived Conflict of Interest... If, because of other work or activities, an Interested Party cannot make this commitment, the Foundation for Public Code may need to take disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.

a. An Interested Party may not take advantage of his/her knowledge or authorities at the Foundation for Public Code for personal gain. Conscious intent to exploit a conflict of interest equates to theft. Failure to recognize a personal conflict of interest does not absolve an Interested Party from responsibility or punishment.

b. An Interested Party must disclose a potential or perceived conflict of interest. Disclosure needs to happen in advance of the transaction or engagement that could lead to personal gain. A conflict of interest that results in personal gain, whether willful or by default is one of the most serious ethical violations at the Foundation for Public Code and is punishable up to and including termination.

c. All Interested Parties at hire and on an annual basis thereafter must sign a Conflict of Interest policy acknowledgment and disclosure form. Thereafter, conflicts of interests should be disclosed as they arise.

## Common Examples of Conflict of Interest

* Having a direct or indirect financial interest in or relationship with a relative, competitor, customer, or supplier 
* Committing the Foundation for Public Code to give its financial or other support to any outside activity or organization without appropriate written authorization
* Accepting personal gifts or entertainment from competitors, customers, suppliers, or potential suppliers. [See our code of conduct.](../organization/staff-code-of-conduct.md)
* Working for a competitor, supplier, or customer while employed by the Foundation for Public Code
* Engaging in self-employment in competition with the Foundation for Public Code
* Using proprietary or confidential the Foundation for Public Code information for personal gain or to the Foundation for Public Codeâ€™s detriment
* Acquiring an interest in property or assets of any kind for the purpose of selling or leasing it to the Foundation for Public Code

## Duty to disclose

It is the duty of an Interested Party to be aware of this policy, and to disclose conflicts as they arise as well as to disclose those situations that are evolving that may result in a Conflict of Interest or an appearance of conflict. Advance disclosure must occur so that a determination may be made as to the appropriate plan of action to manage the conflict or the appearance of conflict.

## How to Disclose

A disclosure can be made one of two ways:

Interested Party discloses to Supervisor. Supervisor must disclose to the Operations coordinator. The Operations coordinator evaluates the disclosure, elevating to Chief Exexcutive if necessary.

Or,

Interested Party discloses to the Operations coordinator. The Operations coordinator evaluates the disclosure, elevating to the Chief Executive if necessary.

### Information to Include in a Disclosure

Be prepared to describe fully any relationships, transactions, positions you hold (volunteer or otherwise), or circumstances that you believe could contribute to a Conflict of Interest between the Foundation for Public Code and your personal interests, financial or otherwise.

### Review of Disclosure and Determination

After disclosure of the Conflict of Interest or perceived Conflict of Interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the Interested Party, a Designated Authority (e.g. the Board of Directors, or a lawyer if it involves a board member) will determine if there is a Conflict of Interest.

### Process if a Conflict of Interest Exists 

* If a Conflict of Interest is determined, the Designated Authority will exercise due diligence to determine whether the Foundation for Public Code can obtain with reasonable effort a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would defuse the Conflict of Interest.
* If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under the circumstances, the Designated Authority may determine by a majority vote of the Disinterested Authorities whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Foundation for Public Code's best interest, or for its own benefit, and/or whether it is fair and reasonable.
* In conformity with the above determination it will make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or agreement or terminating the transaction or agreement.

## Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy 

If the Designated Authority has reasonable cause to believe an Interested Party has failed to disclose an actual or perceived conflict of interest, it will inform the Interested Party of the basis for such belief and afford the interested party an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose. If, after hearing the Interested Party response and after making further investigations as warranted by the circumstances, the Designated Authority determines the interested party has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it will take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action, up to and including termination.
