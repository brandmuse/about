# Conflict of Interest policy

Interested parties must identify, avoid and disclose an actual or perceived Conflict of Interest... If, because of other work or activities, an Interested Party cannot make this commitment, the Foundation for Public Code may need to take disciplinary measures up to and including termination of employment.

a. An Interested Party may not take advantage of his/her knowledge or authorities at the Foundation for Public Code for personal gain. Conscious intent to exploit a conflict of interest equates to theft. Failure to recognize a personal conflict of interest does not absolve an Interested Party from responsibility or punishment.

b. An Interested Party must disclose a potential or perceived conflict of interest. Disclosure needs to happen in advance of the transaction or engagement that could lead to personal gain. A conflict of interest that results in personal gain, whether willful or by default is one of the most serious ethical violations at the Foundation for Public Code and is punishable up to and including termination.

c. All Interested Parties at hire and on an annual basis thereafter must sign a Conflict of Interest policy acknowledgment and disclosure form. Thereafter, conflicts of interests should be disclosed as they arise.
