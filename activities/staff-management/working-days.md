# Working days

The full-time working time is 40 hours per week, divided over five (5) days.
Based on an eight (8) hour day on Monday to Friday. A 30-minute daily lunch break is
not included in these eight (8) hours. We want to prevent our employees from working
overtime, if this can be avoided. If it does occur, staff working more than their contracted
hours in any week will be entitled to compensatory time off, to be taken as soon as reasonably
feasible, and after informing the CEO or operations coordinator of extra time worked and when
the time off is being taken. Make sure to update your calendar accordingly.

## Office hours

You can start anytime between 09.00 - 09.30 am until 17.30 - 18.00 pm.
The daily stand-up takes place at 10.00 am.
Lunch breaks are 30 minutes.
