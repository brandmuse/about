## Authorization

* Board members – two board members can decide on payments. See also bylaws.

## Bank

Our bank is the Rabobank. There is a checking and savings account and a USD account. There are bank cards and credit cards and online keys. Bank cards:
* The Chief Executive, Operations Coordinator, and Treasurer of the board have an Online key for internet banking
* The Chief Executive has a debit card (wereldpas) and Credit card
* The Operations Coordinator is authorized to make 5k payments w/o co-sign
* The Chief Executive’s daily limit is 50k and can be temporarily raised if needed by calling the bank

## Bookkeeping

GetMonkeys is our service provider. They processes and book all the invoices every second Wednesday of the month.ExactOnline is our bookkeeping software. Visionplanner is the forecasting system, connected to ExactOnline. The Operations Coordinator, Chief Executive and Membership Developer have logins, as does our finance consultant until his work ends, autumn 2020.

### Invoices – payable

* Send invoices (incoming) to Exact as PDF (incl expense reports from third parties). Make sure to add the ledger code in the title of the PDF so they know where to book it.
* Do NOT send invoices from Rabo (booked from Bank), GetMonkeys, Tentoo (both linked to ExactOnline).
* Do NOT send receipts underlying expense forms (this would lead to duplication)
* Filing: The Operations Coordinator is keeping invoicesmand expense forms organized by month on the finance drive. There is also a folder for W9s and for ‘orders awaiting invoices’ there.

## Payments

* Invoices and payment receipts come in throughout the month. These can be paid on the fly or saved as batches and paid once or twice a month. After paying the invoices make sure to send the PDF (often you need to “print to file” to create a PDF) to ExactOnline
* Make sure to add the ledger code to the name of the PDF to fully ensure Get Monkey’s books it on the right grootbook (ledger). Best is to add the ledger code, the name of the company and month / period that the invoice covers.
* Make sure to upload the paid invoices and receipts to the “inkoop” folder in the finance drive.
* Get Monkey invoices are sent by mail.
* Individual payments can be made via/with: Rabobank (bank portal), bank card (Chief Executive has one) or credit card (Chief Executive has one).

PLEASE NOTE: Make sure there is always an underlying document (Boekstuk) for each transaction. Having a papertrail is essential.

### Bank statements

Our bank account is linked to ExactOnline, so no need to submit the statements.

### Credit card statements

Send to Exact as PDF. Statements are now available to download from the Rabobank dashboard. Hardcopies are sent to the office.

## Salary administration

* Tentoo does our salary administration (integrated with Get Monkey’s) and Tentoo NMBRS is our salary administration software.
* Login: https://tentoo.nmbrs.nl/applications also via app. The Chief Executive and Operations Coordinator have ‘company’ logins with which they can access the personnel files and keep them up to date
* All employees have their own login as well as access to the app (can be set to English and to Dutch). They can submit expenses, download salary stubs, request vacation days and check their vacation time balance. They can also fill in mutation forms for new addresses, partners, email addresses (we use the personal email for this tool, since the salary stubs etc. have to remain accessible) and emergency contact info
* Expenses have to be approved in the portal. The Chief Executive and Operations Coordinator do this
* Tentoo’s account is linked to ExactOnline, no need to submit anything related to salary administration
* Every month, before the 15th of the month, the Operations Coordinator can send in ‘mutations’ in the personnel admin (change in hours, different pay, reimbursements, care leave, or new hires) anything that has an impact on salaries. Send to Tentoo
* SEPA in Tentoo: Once the salary run has finished the Operations Coordinator opens up the SEPA file and changes the date to the date we want to pay (24 or 25th of the month)
* After uploading the SEPA to the bank, the Operations Coordinator sends a mail to the Chief Executive to release the payments. Make sure to include a PDF so the salaries can be verified. This PDF can be downloaded from Tentoo as well
* The manual for [using NMBRS in Dutch](https://kdb.tentoo.nl/share/s/ZrKQ-HtMSIidMM3TmcVSOg)
* The manual for [using NMBRS in English](https://kdb.tentoo.nl/share/s/kvG2e00CQcyygYlHnKHwuA)
* There is also an app you can download (iPhone & Android). To set up the app, you need to add the domain which is 'tentoo.nmbrs.nl'

## Budget

The budget blueprint which is used as the baseline for budgeting and forecasting is constructed with help of our finance consultant, Rob Schouten. The budget is approved by the board by the end of the year and added to Visionplanner. The Operations Coordinator is responsible for the budget and adding it to Visionplanner. When things drastically change the Operations Coordinator can adjust the budget accordingly both on the blueprint as well as in Visionplanner.

## Loonheffing (LH) – payroll tax

Tentoo reports monthly “loonheffingen en sociale verzekeringspremies”. Tentoo sends an email when the dues have been reported.

* The Operations Coordinator creates the payment, assigns the date (e.g. March needs to be paid in April) and completes the transaction setup in Rabobank. 
* Then the Operations Coordinator sends the Chief Executive an email requesting release of the payment. Ask the Chief Executive to report back when it’s released.
This payment information does not have to be sent to Exact.

## Reporting

After everything is booked for a given month a report can be generated, using Visionplanner. In it, our budget (or forecasts), are entered by the Operations Coordinator and are compared to the period selected.
* The Operations Coordinator has admin access and updates numbers on the fly e.g. when a new gift hits our account, the actuals can be plugged in the forecast. 
* The dashboard and set up has been redesigned with the help of Rob Schouten.
* The Visionplanner dashboard can be presented during a board meeting. Most important for the board will be the runway and current cash position.

## Tax

* We have ANBI status
* We pay wage and social insurance taxes (loonheffing)
* We are VAT exempt
* We are corporate tax (vennootschapsbelasting) exempt
* We can look into [WBSO](https://english.rvo.nl/subsidies-programmes/wbso) in the future

## KBFUS (King Baudouin) Foundation

The King Baudouin Foundation United States (KBFUS) is the leading resource for philanthropic giving to Europe and Africa. We enable U.S. donors to support their favorite causes and organizations overseas, and provide European and African nonprofits with cost-effective solutions to raise funds in the United States.

* We have a fund at the KBFUS Foundation to be able to receiving gifts from the US. The name of our fund is “Foundation for Public Code US Fund”. [This is how the public fund page looks](https://kbfus.networkforgood.com/projects/52915-p-kbfus-funds-foundation-for-public-code-nl).

The Operations Coordinator has log-in credentials to the grants interface where the fund is managed and where reports can be filled. More information about the fund and how the process works can be found on the drive.
