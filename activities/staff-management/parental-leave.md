# Maternity leave

A pregnant employee is entitled to at least 16 weeks of leave. It's about:

* 4 to 6 weeks pregnancy leave - before delivery
* at least 10 weeks of maternity leave - after the birth

In some cases the employee is entitled to extra leave. Namely:

* 2 to 4 weeks extra pregnancy leave with a multiple birth (twins, triplets, etc.)
* Up to 10 weeks of neonatal care leave in the event of long-term hospitalization of the child

## When does maternity leave start and end?

Pregnant employees are entitled to 4-6 weeks pregnancy leave (before the due date) 
and at least 10 weeks maternity leave (after childbirth). If you take less than 6 
weeks pregnancy leave before the birth, you are entitled to add the remaining amount 
(up to 2 weeks) to your maternity leave after the birth. If your baby is born later 
than the due date, your maternity leave begins after the actual birth, and the total 
may therefore be longer than 16 weeks.

If you are expecting multiple births (twins, triplets, etc.) you are entitled to at 
least 20 weeks of leave.If the baby goes into hospital directly after birth or during 
the maternity leave, your entitlement to 10 weeks maternity leave begins after the baby 
has left the hospital. If the mother dies in childbirth, her partner is entitled to the 
maternity leave.

### Maternity pay

You’re entitled to 100% of your earnings, throughout your leave – with a maximum of € 219,28 per day as of 1 January 2020. 
The operations coordinator will apply for maternity allowance on your behalf to the Employee Insurance Agency 
(Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV, in Dutch).If you are expecting multiple births (twins, triplets, etc.), 
you are entitled to full maternity pay for each child.

#### Partner and paternity leave

You are entitled to 1 week of partner or paternity leave after your partner gives birth. 
Partner / paternity leave is the number of working hours in one week. 
If you work full-time this adds up to 5 days of 8 hours. 
This paid leave can be taken any time in the first 4 weeks after the birth of the child. 
During this period of leave you will receive 100% of your salary.

As of 1 July 2020, you will also be entitled to 5 weeks unpaid leave in the first 6 months after the birth. 
If you take unpaid leave you will be able to claim benefits from the Employment Insurance Agency 
(Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV) for up to 70% of your salary.
The government has confirmed that this measure will come into effect under the following conditions:
* the employee must have taken the standard 1-week's partner leave first;
* they must take the leave for whole weeks;
* they can only take the extra weeks of leave during the first 6 months after the birth;
* the employee can only take up non-consecutive weeks if the employer agrees to this.
* If your manager agrees, you can spread the leave over a longer period than 5 weeks. You can also choose to take less 
than 5 weeks.
** This measure is expected to come into force on 1 July 2020. This depends on its acceptance by the upper and lower 
houses of parliament.

##### Parental leave

If you have children aged up to 8 you can take unpaid parental leave. 
Eligibility starts right after you start working. Your entitlement to parental leave is 26 times the 
number of hours you work per week. For example, if you work 32 hours a week, you are entitled 
to 26 x 32 = 832 hours of parental leave. So in theory you can work 1 day a week less for 2 years. 
Important to know: these are unpaid hours.
