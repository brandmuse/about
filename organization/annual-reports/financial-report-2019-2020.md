# Financial Annual Report: 3 June 2019 - 31 December 2020

Foundation for Public Code (Vereniging)

# A. Narrative

The Foundation for Public Code was founded by Ben Cerveny, Boris van Hoytema and Arnout Schuijff in 2019 to guide international collaboration among public organizations around codebase design, quality and governance.

Leveraging 30 combined years of experience working with cities and technology-enabled collaboration, Boris and Ben recognized policy and whitepapers were ineffective catalysts in this space. Their landscape analysis revealed that stewardship was the key to converting the massive public investment in open source and collaboration into long-term, sustainable implementation.

Based on their experience of technological innovation in a traditional industry, Pieter van der Does and Arnout Schuijff (co-founders of the Adyen payments platform) agreed with Ben and Boris that public organizations deserved better software. They joined the Board of Directors to share their expertise and connections.

### 1. General

#### 1.1 Establishment and purpose; mission and vision

##### 1.1.1 Establishment

The Foundation for Public Code was established on June 3, 2019 and is registered in the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 74996452. The statutory name of the organization is: Foundation for Public Code Vereniging (Association) and has its registered office in Amsterdam.

##### 1.1.2 Statutory goal

The goal of the Foundation for Public Code is to support collective development and maintenance of public code (software and policy with a public purpose) in order to reduce risks, increase quality, reduce costs and increase sustainability (article 3.1 of the association bylaws).

Public code stewarded by the Foundation is openly available for reuse by everyone, but only members (wholly publicly owned organizations) can determine the organization’s governance and the stewardship priorities.

The association seeks to achieve its goal by carrying out the following activities (article 3.2 of the association bylaws):

* a.    the provision of services that can increase the sustainability, quality and re-use of public code;
* b.    facilitating and encouraging the sharing of existing public code between public members and other public organizations;
* c.    carrying out research for the (further) development of public code;
* d.    drawing attention to problems ascertained and giving advice with regard to the public code they use;
* e.    and everything related to or conducive to the above, all in the broadest sense.

###### Absence of a profit motive

The Foundation for Public Code is not for profit, as is clear from the work it does and its bylaws (article 3.4)

###### Beneficiary of the liquidation balance

If the Foundation for Public Code’s Board of Directors decides to dissolve the association, the association will continue to exist for as long as is necessary to liquidate the association’s assets. Article 31.4 of the Foundation for Public Code’s bylaws state that any positive balance at the time of liquidation will be given to either:

* a public benefit organization (ANBI) with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code
* a foreign organization dedicated exclusively or nearly completely to the public benefit with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code

##### 1.1.3 Mission and vision

The Foundation for Public Code’s mission is “to support collective development and maintenance of public code in order to reduce risk, increase quality, reduce cost and increase sustainability”.” (established in article 3.1 of the bylaws).

The Foundation for Public Code will deliver its mission by:

* enabling an ecosystem of Public Code software products, developed by and for public administrations to solve real problems for citizens
* building a collaborative community of developers and public organizations, which continuously improves and maintains public code products
* providing a certification system for software as [meeting the standard](https://standard.publiccode.net/) set by the Foundation for Public Code
* building a trusted brand and an awareness of the value of public code.

The Foundation for Public Code is completely unique. There is no other organization that provides impartial codebase stewardship services designed to support open collaboration of public organizations for the benefit of citizens and taxpayers. This distinguishes it from organizations providing open source codebase stewardship for private sector projects, from vendors selling open source software development to public organizations, and from activist groups lobbying governments to spend taxpayer money only on open source software.

##### 1.1.4 Founding principles and cultural values

Founding principles:

* We are a non-profit and non-partisan organization.
* We publish under licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative or Creative Commons licenses that do not limit commercial reuse.
* We are controlled by our members, who are wholly publicly controlled organizations.*
* We strive to keep our membership as accessible as possible to potential members, regardless of size or location.
* We are committed to working with other organizations (commercial or non-profit) to achieve our mission.
* We prioritize long term sustainability and growth for the benefit of our members.
* Our work is open by default and welcomes contributions.

The founding principles were adopted by the Board of Directors on 23 August 2019.

(* In order to start as an association, 4 individual founders will play the role of member until there are enough public members for the organization to sustain itself.)

Cultural values:

Our cultural values are: open, quality, trust, community, helpful. These words signify the qualities we strive for in our activities, products, staff and resources.
