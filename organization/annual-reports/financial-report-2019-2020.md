# Financial Annual Report: 3 June 2019 - 31 December 2020

Foundation for Public Code (Vereniging)

# A. Narrative

The Foundation for Public Code was founded by Ben Cerveny, Boris van Hoytema and Arnout Schuijff in 2019 to guide international collaboration among public organizations around codebase design, quality and governance.

Leveraging 30 combined years of experience working with cities and technology-enabled collaboration, Boris and Ben recognized policy and whitepapers were ineffective catalysts in this space. Their landscape analysis revealed that stewardship was the key to converting the massive public investment in open source and collaboration into long-term, sustainable implementation.

Based on their experience of technological innovation in a traditional industry, Pieter van der Does and Arnout Schuijff (co-founders of the Adyen payments platform) agreed with Ben and Boris that public organizations deserved better software. They joined the Board of Directors to share their expertise and connections.

### 1. General

#### 1.1 Establishment and purpose; mission and vision

##### 1.1.1 Establishment

The Foundation for Public Code was established on June 3, 2019 and is registered in the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 74996452. The statutory name of the organization is: Foundation for Public Code Vereniging (Association) and has its registered office in Amsterdam.

##### 1.1.2 Statutory goal

The goal of the Foundation for Public Code is to support collective development and maintenance of public code (software and policy with a public purpose) in order to reduce risks, increase quality, reduce costs and increase sustainability (article 3.1 of the association bylaws).

Public code stewarded by the Foundation is openly available for reuse by everyone, but only members (wholly publicly owned organizations) can determine the organization’s governance and the stewardship priorities.

The association seeks to achieve its goal by carrying out the following activities (article 3.2 of the association bylaws):

* a.    the provision of services that can increase the sustainability, quality and re-use of public code;
* b.    facilitating and encouraging the sharing of existing public code between public members and other public organizations;
* c.    carrying out research for the (further) development of public code;
* d.    drawing attention to problems ascertained and giving advice with regard to the public code they use;
* e.    and everything related to or conducive to the above, all in the broadest sense.

###### Absence of a profit motive

The Foundation for Public Code is not for profit, as is clear from the work it does and its bylaws (article 3.4)

###### Beneficiary of the liquidation balance

If the Foundation for Public Code’s Board of Directors decides to dissolve the association, the association will continue to exist for as long as is necessary to liquidate the association’s assets. Article 31.4 of the Foundation for Public Code’s bylaws state that any positive balance at the time of liquidation will be given to either:

* a public benefit organization (ANBI) with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code
* a foreign organization dedicated exclusively or nearly completely to the public benefit with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code

##### 1.1.3 Mission and vision

The Foundation for Public Code’s mission is “to support collective development and maintenance of public code in order to reduce risk, increase quality, reduce cost and increase sustainability”.” (established in article 3.1 of the bylaws).

The Foundation for Public Code will deliver its mission by:

* enabling an ecosystem of Public Code software products, developed by and for public administrations to solve real problems for citizens
* building a collaborative community of developers and public organizations, which continuously improves and maintains public code products
* providing a certification system for software as [meeting the standard](https://standard.publiccode.net/) set by the Foundation for Public Code
* building a trusted brand and an awareness of the value of public code.

The Foundation for Public Code is completely unique. There is no other organization that provides impartial codebase stewardship services designed to support open collaboration of public organizations for the benefit of citizens and taxpayers. This distinguishes it from organizations providing open source codebase stewardship for private sector projects, from vendors selling open source software development to public organizations, and from activist groups lobbying governments to spend taxpayer money only on open source software.

#### 1.3 Remuneration Policy

Salaries are competitive and consistent with the social mission of the organization. The Foundation for Public Code reimburses reasonable expenses for staff, contractors and interns.

Compensation for employees of the Foundation for Public Code is at the midpoint of the salary scale in the non-profit sector. The gross annual salary of the Chief Executive of the Foundation for Public Code is 80,000 EUR (including vacation pay - 1 FTE / 12 months). The annual gross salary of the coordinators and codebase stewards is on average 63,000 EUR (including vacation pay, 1 FTE / 12 months). Both pay scales are well below the maximum of 158,000 EUR of Goede Doelen Nederland (GDN) framework.

Because the work we do is innovative and requires diverse expertises, individual agreements can be made with regard to each employee’s salary.

Members of the Board of Directors are not paid for their work. A director may be hired separately and paid by the Foundation for Public Code for work performed in another role (e.g., manager, contractor). The Foundation for Public Code will reimburse directors for expenses incurred in connection with their duties as directors.

If warranted by the employee's performance, a salary increase may be given at the time of contract renewal.

We currently don’t have a pension plan set up for staff. Once the organization matures, secondary employment conditions will be reviewed.

#### 1.4 Guidelines and code of conduct

##### 1.4.1 Guidelines

The Foundation for Public Code complies with the conditions of a Dutch public benefit organization (ANBI). For the preparation of the annual report and financial statements, we used the 650 Fundraising Organizations guideline of the Dutch Council for Annual Reporting (RJ) as issued in RJ-Uiting 2016.

##### 1.4.2 Code of conduct

The staff of the Foundation for Public Code fulfills a crucial role in achieving our mission on behalf of our members, the wider community and the public benefit. Staff are expected to follow the general [code of conduct](https://about.publiccode.net/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) that applies to our community. The staff code of conduct sets out the additional expectations we have of our staff beyond the community code of conduct.

The Foundation for Public Code is a trusted non-partisan organization that operates in sectors of the economy that have significant political interests. It is crucial that the organization as well as its staff are visibly independent, trustworthy, impartial and objective.

###### Conflict of interest

Staff members must immediately declare:

* a personal interest that might impair their independence
* any other potential conflict of interest

Outside activities covered by these rules, paid or unpaid, must first be approved by your manager.

###### Receiving gifts

Staff may not accept gifts, payment, or favours from non-member organizations, individuals or third parties without prior permission.

Gifts may only be accepted without prior approval when:

* there is a cultural, social or diplomatic obligation to accept the gift or it can be considered as promotional merchandise
* the value of the gift does not exceed €50
* there is no accumulation

Hospitality included in participation in an approved mission, conference, workshop or other meeting does not require separate approval.
