# Financial Annual Report: 3 June 2019 - 31 December 2020

Foundation for Public Code (Vereniging)

# A. Narrative

The Foundation for Public Code was founded by Ben Cerveny, Boris van Hoytema and Arnout Schuijff in 2019 to guide international collaboration among public organizations around codebase design, quality and governance.

Leveraging 30 combined years of experience working with cities and technology-enabled collaboration, Boris and Ben recognized policy and whitepapers were ineffective catalysts in this space. Their landscape analysis revealed that stewardship was the key to converting the massive public investment in open source and collaboration into long-term, sustainable implementation.

Based on their experience of technological innovation in a traditional industry, Pieter van der Does and Arnout Schuijff (co-founders of the Adyen payments platform) agreed with Ben and Boris that public organizations deserved better software. They joined the Board of Directors to share their expertise and connections.

## 1. General

### 1.1 Establishment and purpose; mission and vision

#### 1.1.1 Establishment

The Foundation for Public Code was established on June 3, 2019 and is registered in the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 74996452. The statutory name of the organization is: Foundation for Public Code Vereniging (Association) and has its registered office in Amsterdam.

#### 1.1.2 Statutory goal

The goal of the Foundation for Public Code is to support collective development and maintenance of public code (software and policy with a public purpose) in order to reduce risks, increase quality, reduce costs and increase sustainability (article 3.1 of the association bylaws).

Public code stewarded by the Foundation is openly available for reuse by everyone, but only members (wholly publicly owned organizations) can determine the organization’s governance and the stewardship priorities.

The association seeks to achieve its goal by carrying out the following activities (article 3.2 of the association bylaws):

* a.    the provision of services that can increase the sustainability, quality and re-use of public code;
* b.    facilitating and encouraging the sharing of existing public code between public members and other public organizations;
* c.    carrying out research for the (further) development of public code;
* d.    drawing attention to problems ascertained and giving advice with regard to the public code they use;
* e.    and everything related to or conducive to the above, all in the broadest sense.

##### Absence of a profit motive

The Foundation for Public Code is not for profit, as is clear from the work it does and its bylaws (article 3.4)

##### Beneficiary of the liquidation balance

If the Foundation for Public Code’s Board of Directors decides to dissolve the association, the association will continue to exist for as long as is necessary to liquidate the association’s assets. Article 31.4 of the Foundation for Public Code’s bylaws state that any positive balance at the time of liquidation will be given to either:

* a public benefit organization (ANBI) with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code
* a foreign organization dedicated exclusively or nearly completely to the public benefit with a similar goal to the Foundation for Public Code

#### 1.1.3 Mission and vision

The Foundation for Public Code’s mission is “to support collective development and maintenance of public code in order to reduce risk, increase quality, reduce cost and increase sustainability”.” (established in article 3.1 of the bylaws).

The Foundation for Public Code will deliver its mission by:

* enabling an ecosystem of Public Code software products, developed by and for public administrations to solve real problems for citizens
* building a collaborative community of developers and public organizations, which continuously improves and maintains public code products
* providing a certification system for software as [meeting the standard](https://standard.publiccode.net/) set by the Foundation for Public Code
* building a trusted brand and an awareness of the value of public code.

The Foundation for Public Code is completely unique. There is no other organization that provides impartial codebase stewardship services designed to support open collaboration of public organizations for the benefit of citizens and taxpayers. This distinguishes it from organizations providing open source codebase stewardship for private sector projects, from vendors selling open source software development to public organizations, and from activist groups lobbying governments to spend taxpayer money only on open source software.

#### 1.1.4 Founding principles and cultural values

Founding principles:

* We are a non-profit and non-partisan organization.
* We publish under licenses approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) or [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses that do not limit commercial reuse.
* We are controlled by [our members](members.md), who are wholly publicly controlled organizations.*
* We strive to keep our membership as accessible as possible to potential members, regardless of size or location.
* We are committed to working with other organizations (commercial or non-profit) to achieve our mission.
* We prioritize long term sustainability and growth for the benefit of our members.
* Our work is open by default and welcomes contributions.

The founding principles were adopted by the Board of Directors on 23 August 2019.

(* In order to start as an association, 4 individual founders will play the role of member until there are enough public members for the organization to sustain itself.)

Cultural values:

Our cultural values are: open, quality, trust, community, helpful. These words signify the qualities we strive for in our activities, products, staff and resources.

### 1.3 Remuneration Policy

Salaries are competitive and consistent with the social mission of the organization. The Foundation for Public Code reimburses reasonable expenses for staff, contractors and interns.

Compensation for employees of the Foundation for Public Code is at the midpoint of the salary scale in the non-profit sector. The gross annual salary of the Chief Executive of the Foundation for Public Code is 80,000 EUR (including vacation pay - 1 FTE / 12 months). The annual gross salary of the coordinators and codebase stewards is on average 63,000 EUR (including vacation pay, 1 FTE / 12 months). Both pay scales are well below the maximum of 158,000 EUR of Goede Doelen Nederland (GDN) framework.

Because the work we do is innovative and requires diverse expertises, individual agreements can be made with regard to each employee’s salary.

Members of the Board of Directors are not paid for their work. A director may be hired separately and paid by the Foundation for Public Code for work performed in another role (e.g., manager, contractor). The Foundation for Public Code will reimburse directors for expenses incurred in connection with their duties as directors.

If warranted by the employee's performance, a salary increase may be given at the time of contract renewal.

We currently don’t have a pension plan set up for staff. Once the organization matures, secondary employment conditions will be reviewed.

### 1.4 Guidelines and code of conduct

#### 1.4.1 Guidelines

The Foundation for Public Code complies with the conditions of a Dutch public benefit organization (ANBI). For the preparation of the annual report and financial statements, we used the 650 Fundraising Organizations guideline of the Dutch Council for Annual Reporting (RJ) as issued in RJ-Uiting 2016.

#### 1.4.2 Code of conduct

The staff of the Foundation for Public Code fulfills a crucial role in achieving our mission on behalf of our members, the wider community and the public benefit. Staff are expected to follow the general [code of conduct](https://about.publiccode.net/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html) that applies to our community. The staff code of conduct sets out the additional expectations we have of our staff beyond the community code of conduct.

The Foundation for Public Code is a trusted non-partisan organization that operates in sectors of the economy that have significant political interests. It is crucial that the organization as well as its staff are visibly independent, trustworthy, impartial and objective.

##### Conflict of interest

Staff members must immediately declare:

* a personal interest that might impair their independence
* any other potential conflict of interest

Outside activities covered by these rules, paid or unpaid, must first be approved by your manager.

##### Receiving gifts

Staff may not accept gifts, payment, or favours from non-member organizations, individuals or third parties without prior permission.

Gifts may only be accepted without prior approval when:

* there is a cultural, social or diplomatic obligation to accept the gift or it can be considered as promotional merchandise
* the value of the gift does not exceed €50
* there is no accumulation

Hospitality included in participation in an approved mission, conference, workshop or other meeting does not require separate approval.

### 1.5 Communication with stakeholders, community and general public

The Foundation for Public Code is an open organization with collaboration and transparency at its core. Our goal is to ensure that everything we do is open and publicly accessible. We document all of our activities, processes and organizational information so that our stakeholders, the community, and the general public can contribute to our work. The documentation of our work is core to our ability to deliver on our mission together with the community.

We continuously publish updates about our work via our website, social media, and mailing lists, in order to keep our audience informed. We also attend events throughout the year to engage with our stakeholders and raise awareness about public code.

### 1.6 Risk paragraph

The Foundation for Public Code was wholly philanthropically funded during the reporting period. We have received donations from three different parties:

* Dia Holding B.V. (Arnout Schuijff)
* DC Butterfield and AD Rubio Memorial Foundation (Stewart Butterfield)
* Elkes Foundation (Josh Elkes)

These philanthropists share our commitment to our mission. To prevent undue influence, all donations are un-earmarked and go into our general operating budget, in compliance with our status as a Dutch public benefit organization (ANBI).

During this start-up phase, we try to look two years ahead with our financial planning.  The organization  has low financial risk: there are no debts and no assets. There is a loan agreement (anti-kraak) for the office, which incurs no rent. In the second quarter of 2020, we transitioned to remote-first working in response to government recommendations during the Covid-19 crisis. When the loan agreement expires at the end of June 2021, the contract can be extended on a monthly basis until a tenant is found. All our activities are location independent, meaning the organization can continue to function in a remote-first context. Nevertheless, some budget has been set aside starting from the third quarter of 2021 in case a new office space is needed.

The current financial situation gives the organization financial security until April 2022. We expect to receive both, more member contributions, as well as more philanthropic gifts. However, it is possible that the income will be insufficient to cover our operational expenses. Costs will then have to be drastically reduced. Since personnel costs comprise the majority of our costs, reductions will need to be made in this area.

### 1.7 The impact of the Covid-19 crisis and our continuity assumption

The Covid-19 crisis affected our freedom to do things and the effectiveness of our work. Due to travel restrictions and national containment measures, we were not able to meet with public organizations or attend events abroad, and our staff had limited  possibilities to work in the office. Despite the physical limitations, we were able to maintain and generate relationships using digital means.

Due to the composition of our income stream, we do not expect a negative impact of the Covid-19 crisis on our operations in the short term.

The Foundation for Public Code is in the start-up phase and has not been able to build up resilience, for example in the form of a continuity reserve. As indicated earlier, the organization has a liquidity buffer until April 2022.

### 1.8 Future paragraph

The Foundation for Public Code maintains a clear financial policy with a healthy source of income. In the future, we aim to be primarily member funded, with additional philanthropic support. The financial sustainability of our organization should be secured by membership dues, with philanthropic gifts used for additional activities such as awareness raising and ecosystem growth.

## 2. Fiscal affairs
### 2.1 Public Benefit Organization

On 3 June 2019, a notice was received from the Tax Office/Registration and Succession in 's-Hertogenbosch that the Foundation for Public Code Vereniging has been designated as an ANBI. The association will continue to have the ANBI status in 2021.

All of the Foundation’s funds are spent on achieving its mission and benefiting the public.  Funds are not spent on the exclusive benefit of our members or other individuals.

## 3. Administrative affairs

The administration in 2019/2020 was carried out by the Operations Coordinator and the accounting firm Get Monkeys. We hired an experienced financial consultant to review the checks and balances budget, as well as incorporating the loan/gift structure of the gift from Dia Holding B.V.

The financial statements for the period from June 3, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were compiled by the external consultants and the annual report was prepared by the Board of Directors and Operations Coordinator.

The financial statements consist of the balance sheet, statement of revenue and expenses, cash flow statement, and notes to the balance sheet.

### 5.3 Notes to the financial statements

General

These are the first financial statements of The Foundation for Public Code Vereniging. The book year is an extended book year from 3rd June 2019 - 31st December 2020.

We chose to divide the reporting period into 2 segments from: 3rd June 2019 - 31st dec 2019 and 1st January 2020 - 31st December 2020.

Continuity

With regard to the continuity of the Foundation for Public Code Vereniging we would like to refer to the board report.

Currencies

Items included in the financial statements of the company are valued with due regard for the currency in the economic environment in which the company carries out most of its activities (the functional currency). The financial statements are denominated in euros; this is both the functional currency and presentation currency of the company.

General principles

The financial statements are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of Title 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Accounting Standards applicable to fundraising organizations (Richtlijn 650 Fondsenwervende organisaties as published by the Dutch Accounting Standards Board ('Raad voor de Jaarverslaggeving') as set out in “RJ-Uiting 2016-13)”.

Assets and liabilities are generally valued at historical cost, production cost or at fair value at the time of acquisition.

If no specific valuation principle has been stated, valuation is at historical cost. The valuation principles and method of determining the result are the same as those used in the previous year, with the exception of the changes in accounting policies as set out in the relevant notes.

Principles of tangible assets

Other tangible fixed assets are valued at historical cost or production cost including directly attributable costs, less straight-line depreciation based on the expected future life and impairments.

Subsidies on investments will be deducted from the historical cost price or production cost of the assets to which the subsidies relate.

Principles of receivables

Receivables are initially valued at the fair value of the consideration to be received, including transaction costs if material. Receivables are subsequently valued at the amortised cost price. Provisions for bad debts are deducted from the carrying amount of the receivable.

Principles of cash and cash equivalents

Cash at banks and in hand represent cash in hand, bank balances and deposits with terms of less than twelve months. Overdrafts at banks are recognised as part of debts to lending institutions under current liabilities. Cash at banks and in hand is carried at nominal value.

Principles of equity

The equity position of the Foundation for Public Code Vereniging is the result of the assets minus the liabilities.

A part of the equity position is the General reserve. A positive result of the income statement is attributed to the general reserve, while a negative result is deducted from it.

Principles of non-current liabilities

On initial recognition long-term debts are recognised at fair value. Transaction costs which can be directly attributed to the acquisition of the long-term debts are included in the initial recognition. After initial recognition long-term debts are recognised at the amortised cost price, being the amount received taking into account premiums or discounts and minus transaction costs.

Principles of current liabilities

On initial recognition current liabilities are recognised at fair value. After initial recognition current liabilities are recognised at the amortised cost price, being the amount received taking into account premiums or discounts and minus transaction costs. This is usually the nominal value.

Principles for determining the result

The result is the difference between income and cost in the income-statement of the Foundation for Public Code Vereniging.

Principles of revenue

Income comprises the income from member contributions, donations from private individuals and institutions, subsidies, and other income (e.g. results from financial instruments: interest, dividend).

Principles of operating expenses

Costs are determined on a historical basis and are attributed to the reporting year to which they relate.

Principles of wages and salaries; social security and pension costs

The benefits payable to personnel are recorded in the income statement on the basis of the employment conditions.

Principles of financial income and expenses

Interest income and expenses are recognized on a pro rata basis, taking account of the effective interest rate of the assets and liabilities to which they relate. In accounting for interest expenses, the recognized transaction expenses for loans received are taken into consideration.

### 5.4 Notes to the balance sheet
