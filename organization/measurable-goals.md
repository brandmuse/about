# Measurable goals: December 2020 - March 2021

### Until March 2021, we are working towards achieving the following four outcomes. Each outcome is informed by one or more indicators of success.

## 1. The Foundation for Public Code is a sustainable association of public organizations

### Success indicators

1. Public organizations become members of the association, becoming co-owners and partaking in the General Assembly<br>
**Baseline**: 0 members, 10 organizations in “lead”<br>
**Target**: 3 members, 15 organizations in “lead”<br>
**Means of verification:** Membership contracts signed, membership pipeline documentation
2. Funds secured to finance the Foundation<br>
**Baseline**: € 2 Million<br>
**Target**: € 3 Million<br>
**Means of verification:** Philanthropic gifts received; payment requests sent; membership dues paid

## 2. Codebase communities we work with are more open and collaborative, with healthy and growing communities

### Success indicators

1. Codebases under stewardship are reused by new public organizations<br>
**Baseline**: Current number of implementations of the codebase<br>
**Target**: 2 new implementations per codebase<br>
**Means of verification:** Number of public organizations testing or implementing a stewarded codebase

## 3. Public organizations benefit from being members of the Foundation for Public Code

### Success indicators

1. Benefits (↓ cost, ↑ control, ↓ risk, ↑ quality) of working with the Foundation are described by members in quantitative or qualitative case studies<br>
**Baseline**: 0 case studies<br>
**Target**: 2 case studies<br>
**Means of verification:** Testimonials/statements on measurable benefits provided by members and published in case studies

## 4. Our audience* experiences a consolidated brand, with accessible content that is useful, relevant, timely and inspiring

### Success indicators

1. Request for 1:1 contact, including pitching codebases, membership, and tools increase<br>
**Baseline**: establish baseline<br>
**Target**: TBD once baselines determined<br>
**Means of verification:** Tracking email and personal approaches, requests for our tools in their preferred format/language, emails to info, phonecalls
2. Being invited to speak at or contribute to others’ platforms (press, publications and events)<br>
**Baseline**: establish baseline<br>
**Target**: TBD once baselines determined<br>
**Means of verification:** Events and communications calendar (proportion invitations vs we pitch)
3. References in government documents, recommendations and referrals<br>
**Baseline**: 2 mentions in government documents, 1 policy referral, listed in civic-tech and tech resource lists<br>
**Target**: 30% increase in mentions<br>
**Means of verification:** List on publiccode.net, use for communications
4. Our community keeps engaging with us and grows<br>
**Baseline**: no analytics<br>
**Target**: set up analytics<br>
**Means of verification:** Tracking engagement through: recurring community call participants, being @’d in conversations, resharing our content, total numbers grow month on month
5. The Standard for Public Code is widely used and disseminated<br>
**Baseline**: establish baseline<br>
**Target**: track dissemination<br>
**Means of verification:** Code forks; Standard downloads; mentions

**audience is derived from the three previous outcomes and consists of existing communities*
