# Roadmap

The roadmap is where development of the future activities for the Foundation for Public Code happens.

Items on the roadmap can be diverse ranging from smaller new activities that can be performed to big structural shifts in organizational execution. This means items in 'Further out' might never be brought into execution and can contradict each other. Everything on the roadmap needs to align with the [mission and founding principles](mission.md).

The [general assembly](governance-model.md#general-assembly) decides to resource activities from the roadmap in the budget and [policy plan](policy-plan.md).
